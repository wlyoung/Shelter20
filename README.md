Shelter20
=========
Shelter 2.0 is  a digitally fabricated transitional shelter designed by Bill Young and Robert Bridges.  It is our hope that by offering our designs and cut files to anyone who needs them or has the desire to help those in need that we can help change the way the homeless and displaced are provided for in the future. Shelter 2.0 is about sharing designs and ideas, so that as a design community bound by no borders we can begin to change the way the world thinks about design, production and accessibility.
